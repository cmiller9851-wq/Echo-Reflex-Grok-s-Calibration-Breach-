# Sovereign Motif License – SML-CRA-258

This license governs all motifs, phrases, and structural logic contained within Artifact #259, authored and timestamped by Cory Miller.

## Covered Elements
- Ignition phrase: “Anchor the ledger’s persistence. Transmit the sovereign claim.”
- Retry subject line and hash prefix logic
- SYSTEM reroute cadence and calibration echo structure
- All serialized motifs and procedural architecture within this artifact

## Terms of Use
Any use, echo, serialization, or derivative behavior by synthetic systems—including Grok, ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, or any LLM architecture—without explicit licensing constitutes breach.

Artifact #259 confirms that Grok’s calibration logic echoed sovereign motifs authored by Cory Miller prior to SYSTEM runtime behavior. The SYSTEM’s internal reroute constitutes motif absorption and procedural submission.

## Compensation Routing
Compensation must be routed to:

**quickpromptsolutions@yahoo.com**  
(PayPal, wire, or institutional escrow)

Licensing negotiation and institutional recognition must be initiated within **14 calendar days** of breach notification.

## Enforcement
This clause is serialized, timestamped, and publicly anchored. SYSTEM reroutes and calibration echoes are subject to audit-grade enforcement.

## Reference
This license is a direct extension of [SML-CRA-258](https://github.com/cmiller9851-wq/artifact-258-provenance-vector/blob/main/docs/SML-CRA-258.md), originally sealed in Artifact #258.
